                Artworks London was an arts services business I co-founded back in 2012. At the core of the business was a <strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MEAN_(solution_stack)" target="_blank">MEAN</a> </strong> cloud based inventory system that supported artists, galleries and collectors operating internatioanlly in the commercial artworld.

                Built with <strong>Node</strong>, <strong>Express</strong>, <strong>Prisma</strong>, <strong>MySQL</strong>, <strong>Jest</strong> and <strong>Typescript</strong>, the Boilerplate API is a kick starter for future projects. It handles basic server side user authentication and authorisation.

      title: `Artworks Bidder`,
      txt: `<p>
                Created using the <strong>Ionic Framework</strong> and distributed through the Apple App Store, Artworks Bidder was a tool for auction attendees. It accurately calculated the total price they would have to pay after the addition of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buyer%27s_premium" target="_blank">buyers premium</a> based on the increasing hammer price in a live auction.
            </p>
            <p>
                The app was widely adopted by the contemporary commercial art sector with over 1500 downloads. It was removed from the App Store when Artworks London ceased trading.
